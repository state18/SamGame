TODO on 3/15/2016
-----------------

Rework player detection for ladders. The method will probably revolve around the center of the player and how close it is to the center
of the ladder. UPDATE: It's fine the way it is for now.

Make the disappearing platforms in level 3 fall instead of outright vanish.

Put together the animation controller for the fire wizard. UPDATE: Done

Design a half-block structure that has half the height of a regular tile. This is so objects such as bombs and projectiles can pass
through but blocks the player.

Follow the other instructions preceded by the "IMPORTANT:" tag in the task list.
